"""Role-gated cost redaction for activity/history payloads.

Cost (``cost_price`` / ``cost_total`` and any cost price list) is visible only to manager+
everywhere else in the app (item detail, list, dashboard cost basis). The ledger/activity feeds must honour
the same rule, enforced **server-side** so raw cost never ships to an under-threshold
role. This is the single source of truth for that redaction, used by both the ledger
router and the dashboard activity endpoints.

Every ledger reader (the event list, a single event, the dashboard activity and History)
shows an event only to a role holding the permission it is read with: the one its module names
on its ``projection_handler`` contribution, enabled or not, or core's own for the events no
module owns.
